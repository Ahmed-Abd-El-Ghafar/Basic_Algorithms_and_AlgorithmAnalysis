- In-place Sorting and Not-in-place Sorting :
    - Sorting algorithms may require some "extra space" for comparison and temporary storage of few data elements.
	1) In-place Sorting : Don't require any extra space and sorting is said to happen in-place
		- Ex. in the same Array -> Ex. (Bubble sort)
	2) Not-in-place Sorting : The program "requires space" which is more than or equal to the elements being sorted.
